# NeaPolis Innvoation Summer Campus 2022 Examples
Examples made for ChibiOS/RT + HAL during the NeaPolis Innovation Summer Campus 2022.

These examples have been tested on ChibiStudio 2022-01 for Windows. 
You can download this version of the development environment at
[OSDN ChibStudio Project](https://osdn.net/projects/chibios/downloads/70767/ChibiStudio_Windows_2022-01.7z/)

These examples were made by Student Tutors and NeaPolis Innovation Summer Campus collaborators.

## Running examples
1 - You can either download the zipped version of this repository or clone the repository into the ChibiStudio directory.

2 - Import the projects into the ChibiStudio workspace (you can also leave the "Copy project into workspace" option unchekced if downloaded correctly the repository)


## Examples
You can read and travel the examples as you desire, but the suggested path is the following:
** Only here listed examples have been updated and tested!**
