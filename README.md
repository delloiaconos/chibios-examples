Examples made for ChibiOS/RT + HAL during the NeaPolis Innovation Summer Campus 2022.

These examples have been tested on ChibiStudio 2022-01 for Windows. 
You can download this version of the development environment at
https://osdn.net/projects/chibios/downloads/70767/ChibiStudio_Windows_2022-01.7z/

These examples were made by Student Tutors and NeaPolis Innovation Summer Campus collaborators.

## Running examples

## Examples
You can read and travel the examples as you desire, but the suggested path is the following:

1 - GPIOs Examples
2 - Thread Examples (THD)
3 - UART and SERIAL (To Be Done...)
4 - Analog to Digital Converter Examples (ADC)

### ADC
- ADC00 - Base demo to include the ADC into your NUCLEO64 based project.
- ADC01 - Simple project with single acquisition from a single channel.
- ADC02 - Asynchronous conversion call.
- ADC03 - Asynchronous sampling and over serial display.
- ADC04 - TIMER triggered ADC conversion.
