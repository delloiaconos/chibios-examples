# ChibiOS Examples
A set of examples made for ChibiOS/RT 21.11.x (Vettica) + HAL stable branch .
These examples have been tested on ChibiStudio 2023-02 for Windows. 

ChibiStudio version: [Sourceforge ChibStudio Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/chibios/files/ChibiStudio%20Windows/ChibiStudio_Windows_2023-02.7z)

ChibiOS version: [ChibiOS 21.11.x](https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS/tree/stable_21.11.x)

These examples are cured by Salvatore Dello Iacono, for the NeaPolis Innovation Summer Campus's Tutors and Students.
